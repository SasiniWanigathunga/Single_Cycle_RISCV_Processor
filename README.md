# Single_Cycle_RISCV_Processor

32 bit non-pipelined RISC-V processor using Micropramming with 3 bus structure.  This is RV32I implementation. 

1.  All computational instructions covered by instruction types R and I. 
2. All memory access instructions (load and store) - I and S type instructions
3.  All Control Flow instructions :  SB type

(a) MEMCOPY - Copies an array of size N from one location to another. N > 1 
Determine the max N that you can use for this instruction)
(b) MUL - Unsigned Multiplication (Note that RV32I does not include multiplication instructions)
Identify the limits for operands of this instruction
